->print():
======
It is a predefine function in Python.The main objective of print() function is to 
display the message/content on console/application console using '' or "",'''''',"""""" or variable_name(an identifier_name).


Ex1:
====
print('Core Python Sessions are going on at IHUB')
print("Core Python Sessions are going on at IHUB")
print('''Core Python Sessions are going on at IHUB''')
print("""Core Python Session are going on at IHUB""")
Pid=1001 
print(Pid)

Q1)What is the difference between Program and Script?
=====================================


Python as a Program:
==============
If the developers/programmers/application developers/software developers are
writing the business logic(Python Source Code) without any predefine module then
it is said to be Python as a Program.


Ex1:
===
print('Python Developer')
print()
print('Full Stack Python Developer')
print()
print('AI Engineer')
print()
print('DS Developer')
print()
print("End of an application")


Python as a Scripting Language:
=====================
If the developers/programmers/application developers/software engineers
are writing the business logic(Python Source Code) with one or more then 
one predefine module then it is said to be Python as a Scripting language

Note:
====  
       In Python Programming Language we do have 160000+ predefine module

time module:
=========
It is a predefine module in Python.The main objective of time module is to work on
time in hours_format and minute_Format,second_format.To use time module 
in python we use import keyword followed predefine module name

import time 
time.sleep(3) ----> after message will be displayed


Ex1:
===
import time 
time.sleep(2)
print("Welcome to Python as a Scripting Language")


Ex2:
===
import time 
print('A for Apple')
print()
print('B for Bannana')
print()
print('C for Carrot')
print()
print('D for Dragion_Fruit')
print()
time.sleep(3)
print('End of an application')
